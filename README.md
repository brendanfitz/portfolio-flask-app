# metis-projects-flask-app
This is the repository of source code for my python flask app hosted on Heroku to exhibit my data science project opus, d3 visualizations, deep learning projects, and data science blogs/ramblings.

The link for the site can be found at [www.brendan-fitzpatrick.com](https://www.brendan-fitzpatrick.com).

Enjoy!
